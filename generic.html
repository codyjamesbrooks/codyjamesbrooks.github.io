									<p>The short answer is, Cody Brooks. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit more about me!</p>

									<p>At the current moment I am an aspiring data scientist. I studied Mathematics at the University of Minnesota and the University of Colordao Colordao Springs. In order to put my mathematics education to better use, I have taught myself the python programming language and am currently seeking employment using these skills. I passionately believe there is not anything that I cannot teach myself, and I genuinely love learning. If you would like a better idea of what I am currently working on take a look at some of the projects on this site. </p>

									<h2>Everything up to now</h2>
									<p>I was raised in Marshfield, Wisconsin and was treated to the stereotypical Wisconsin upbringing. I milked cows, I ate cheese, with an extra side of cheese, and since as long as I can remember had a passion for mathematics.</p>
									
									<p>Professionally I firmly believe that there isn't a job that I can't do. I have managed a grocery store, tutored mathematics across every level of college mathematics, and been a rock-climbing coach. I even spent a summer as a camp counselor for physically disabled children. I am the hardest worker I know and am always trying to improve my performance by leveraging any tool that I can. </p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Hobbies & Pursuits</h2>
									<p>I have been an avid climber for the past 10+ years. I have climbed in 12 states and counting and hope to one day have climbed something on every continent. If you donâ€™t find me at the climbing gym you will most likely run into me reading a book, working on a new data project, or spending quality time with my loving partner Anna.  </p>
