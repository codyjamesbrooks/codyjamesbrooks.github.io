									<p>The short answer is, Cody Brooks. Hello. I am pleased that you have found your way to my website.</p>

									<p>At the current moment I am an aspiring data scientist. I studied Mathematics at the University of Minnesota and the University of Colordao Colordao Springs. I am very comfortable with the python programming language and am always taking on new projects. My most recent focus has been on the exciting field of machine learning. Hop on over to the projects page, to take a look at things that I have been working on.</p>

									<h2>Everything up to now</h2>
									<p>I was raised in Marshfield, Wisconsin and was treated to the sterotypical Wisconsin upbringing. I milked cows, I ate chese, with an extra side of chese, and since as long as I can remember had a passion for mathemitics. </p>
									
									<p>Professionally I firmly believe that there isn't a job that I can't do. I have managed a grocery store, tutored mathematics across every level of college mathematics, been a rock climbing coach, I even spent a summer as a camp councler for physically disabled childern. I am the hardest worker I know, and take complete ownership of all of my responsibilites.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Hobbies & Pursuits</h2>
									<p>I have been an avid climber for the past 10+ years. I have climbed in 12 states and counting and hope to one day have climbed something on every contentient. It is a pursuit of passion that I will carry with me through my entire life. When I am not climbing I am either reading, or working on a coding puzzle, or spending quality time with my lovely partner Anna.</p>
