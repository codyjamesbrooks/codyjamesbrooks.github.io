										I pulled the data for this analysis off of the internet. It contains 63 ordered pairs, so it should be considered an exceedingly small data set and any conclusions drawn should be taken with that in mind. The purpose of this analysis was twofold. The first purpose was academic, I wanted to practice various machine learning model fitting techniques on an active data set. The second purpose, and the overall point of Machine Learning at large, was to be able to create a predictive model with which we could draw conclusions from. The 63 ordered pairs (displayed to left) form an excellent feature target relationship. Below I will spend some time talking about the different models that I fit to the data.</p>

										The first model I fit on to the data was a k-nearest neighbors regression model. The highest test score for this model was found to be .71. Inside the project you can see that I performed a test to find an optimal value for k, and included a graph showing exactly what this predictive model would look like. I discovered that, at its best a nearest neighborsâ€™ analysis would underfit the data set and would fail to produce a trustworthy predictive model.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="projimages/MLSwed03.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>Linear Regression Model</h4>The next model that I used was a Linear Regression Model. In this situation, where we have only one feature, a linear regression model ends up taking the form of a line of best fit. To the left is a graph of the resulting model. As in the case of the nearest neighbors model the linear regression model also unfortunately underfits our data set, the best score that it is able to achieve is .69. This model is unable to draw a clear distinction between the more heavily clustered data points.</p>
