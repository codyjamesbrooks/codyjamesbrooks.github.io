									I pulled the data for this analysis off of the internet (source). It contains 63 ordered pairs, so it should be considered a very small data set and any conclusions drawn should be taken with that in mind. The purpose of this analysis was two fold. The first purpose was academic, I wanted to pratice various machine learning model fitting teqniques on an active data set. The second purpose, and the overall point of Machine Learning at large, was to be able to create a predictive model with which we could draw conclusions from. The 63 ordered pairs (displayed to left) form an excellent feature trget relationship. Below I will spend some time talking about the different models that I fit to the data.</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="projimages/MLSwed02.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>K Nearest Neighbors Regression Model</h4>
									The first model I fit on to the data was a k-nearest neighbors regression model. The highest test score for this model was found to be .71. Inside the project you can see that I performed a quick test to find an optimal value for k, and also included a graph showing exactly what the this predictive model would look like. I discovered that, at its best a nearest neighbors analysis would underfit the data set, and would fail to produce a trustworthy predictive model.</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="projimages/MLSwed03.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>Linear Regression Model</h4>The next model that I used was a Linear Regression Model. In this situtation, where we have only one feature, a linear regression model will end up taking the form of a line of best fit. To the left is an graph of the resulting line. As in the case of the nearest neighbors model the, the linear regression model also unfortunately underfits our data set, the best score that it is able to achieve is .69. This model is unable to draw a clear distinction between the more heavily clustered data points. </p>
