									<h4>The Data Set</h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/MLSwed01.jpg" alt="" /></span>I pulled the data for this analysis off of the internet (source). It contains 63 ordered pairs, so it should be considered a very small data set and any conclusions drawn should be taken with that in mind. The purpose of this analysis was two fold. The first purpose was academic, I wanted to pratice various machine learning model fitting teqniques on an active data set. The second purpose, and the overall point of Machine Learning at large, was to be able to create a predictive model with which we could draw conclusions from. The 63 ordered pairs (displayed to left) form an excellent feature trget relationship. Below I will spend some time talking about the different models that I fit to the data.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/MLSwed02.jpg" alt="" /></span>The first model I fit on to the data was a k-nearest neighbors regression model. The highest test score for this model was found to be .71. Inside the project you can see that I performed a quick test to find an optimal value for k, and also included a graph showing exactly what the this predictive model would look like. I discovered that, at its best a nearest neighbors analysis would underfit the data set, and would fail to produce a trustworthy predictive model.</p>

									<h2>Everything up to now</h2>
									<p>I was raised in Marshfield, Wisconsin and was treated to the sterotypical Wisconsin upbringing. I milked cows, I ate chese, with an extra side of chese, and since as long as I can remember had a passion for mathemitics. </p>
									
									<p>Professionally I firmly believe that there isn't a job that I can't do. I have managed a grocery store, tutored mathematics across every level of college mathematics, been a rock climbing coach, I even spent a summer as a camp councler for physically disabled childern. I am the hardest worker I know, and take complete ownership of all of my responsibilites.</p>

									<h2>Hobbies & Pursuits</h2>
									<p>I have been an avid climber for the past 10+ years. I have climbed in 12 states and counting and hope to one day have climbed something on every contentient. It is a pursuit of passion that I will carry with me through my entire life. When I am not climbing I am either reading, or working on a coding puzzle, or spending quality time with my lovely partner Anna.</p>
