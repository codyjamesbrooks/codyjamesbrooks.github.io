										<h2>Applying Python, Pandas, and Object-Oriented Programming in a retail environment</h2>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="projimages/PPOOP01.JPG" alt=""/></span><h4>Project Goal</h4>
										The goal of this project was to use python, pandas, and object-oriented programming to create a tool that would assist me in pointing out specific changes my department managers could make in order to improve overall sales at the grocery store I was managing. Specifically I was trying to answer the question "What are the products in my store that could be selling better?". As the project contains confidential sales data, it doesn't have a public repo on GitHub. But below I have gone into details regarding the methods that I used to approach this challenge. </p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="projimages/PPOOP03.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>The Data Set</h4>
										I had access to all of the sales data, at a product level, across every store in the company (155 different stores spread across the western US). I set the data up in a pandas data frames as such, broke up by department, then by month. This resulted in a data frame for each department in the store (grocery, dairy, etc..), for each month of the year. Inside each data frame every item that was sold would have a row for each store that sold that item, and for how times that item sold during the given month. The next step in the project involved figuring out which stores to compare in order to determine the items at each store had the most room for improvment.</p>

										<p><span class="image right"><img src="projimages/PPOOP02.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>Grouping Stores</h4>I decided to group the stores together based on the population of the city the store was located in. To do that I made use of an US Census API. The API allowed me to dynamically group stores in a manner that wouldn't need to be updated manually as city populations changed. Having a population based grouping in place allowed me to effectively judge an items sales, at each store, by comparing that same items sales at stores in simillary sized cities.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="projimages/PPOOP04.JPG" alt="" /></span><h4>Object-Oriented Programming</h4>From there I used OOP to set up a class that would allow each store to indivdually instantiate itself as the primary store viewing the data. That allowed each store to utilize each method that I created, with their store in mind. In that way I was able to not only create a tool that I could use to assist myself while managing my store, but every store company wide could perform the same analysis simply by creating a new class object.</p>
