									<h4><a href='project/01.html'>Machine Learning with Swedish Insurance Claims</a></h4>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/SwedML.jpg" alt="" /></span>The idea behind this project was to be able to predict the total value that a certain Swedish auto insurance company could expect to pay knowing how many claims were filled over a given month. I used multiple machine learning techniques during this project such as KNearestNeighbors and Logistic Regression. I also created a number of graphs using Matplotlib that help visiualize the data as well as the Machine Learing process. I am still adding to this project so stay tuned for updates.</p>

									<h2>Everything up to now</h2>
									<p>I was raised in Marshfield, Wisconsin and was treated to the sterotypical Wisconsin upbringing. I milked cows, I ate chese, with an extra side of chese, and since as long as I can remember had a passion for mathemitics. </p>
									
									<p>Professionally I firmly believe that there isn't a job that I can't do. I have managed a grocery store, tutored mathematics across every level of college mathematics, been a rock climbing coach, I even spent a summer as a camp councler for physically disabled childern. I am the hardest worker I know, and take complete ownership of all of my responsibilites.</p>

									<h2>Hobbies & Pursuits</h2>
									<p>I have been an avid climber for the past 10+ years. I have climbed in 12 states and counting and hope to one day have climbed something on every contentient. It is a pursuit of passion that I will carry with me through my entire life. When I am not climbing I am either reading, or working on a coding puzzle, or spending quality time with my lovely partner Anna.</p>
